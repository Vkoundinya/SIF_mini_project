The European debt crisis or The Europe's Sovereign Debt Crisis (2008) had left many countries on the verge of bankruptcy. Portugal was one among those countries that faced the suffered severely. Though there were many other factors that contributed the crisis, low literacy rate and high dropout rate have been most important contributing factors for Portugal's financial crisis . As per a report of 2012, less than 30% of Portuguese adults have graduated from high schools. Recent survey reports presented by The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) showed the increase in school enrollment of children. However, still the countries literacy rate lays behind average literacy rate of OECD countries.

In this project we are trying to analyze various factors affecting students performance on Portuguese schools based on the original study conducted by [Paulo Cortez](https://pcortez.dsi.uminho.pt/) and Alice Silva titled as *"USING DATA MINING TO PREDICT SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENT PERFORMANCE"*.

**AIM of the project**
Our aim is to perform exploratory and explanatory analysis of the dataset. In the mean process we are going to analyze students performance, their family and other habits, failures, and ambition for higher study as well.
